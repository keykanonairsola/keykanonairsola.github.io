## Install FaceSwap

We need to use an example which is not Fluid Simulation to show the ability of cloudlet. So we choose faceswap: https://github.com/cmusatyalab/faceswap


# dlib

First, we can download dlib 19.0 on https://github.com/davisking/dlib/releases/tag/v19.0. 
Socond, we should install some tools. Input the command sudo apt-get install cmake and sudo apt-get install libboost-Python-dev.
Third, we need to enter the dlib file, and then input the command sudo python setup.py install .

TroubleShooing
Maybe there is no setuptools. we need to download setuptools and install.
Maybe CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM is not set. I just install make and solve the trouble.
